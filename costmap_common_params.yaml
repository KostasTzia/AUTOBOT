  ] # Footprint is setting the 2D shape of the robot (all measurements in meters)

obstacle_range: 2.5 # the range of sensor readings in meters
raytrace_range: 2.5 # the range of free space detection in in meters
inflation_radius: 0.22 # The radius of inflation arround obstacles

observation_sources: scan # The "observation_sources" defines a list of sensors that are going
                          # to be passing information to the costmap

scan: { data_type: LaserScan, topic: scan, marking: true, clearing: true } # The observation source http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup

# data_type : its LaserScan cause of the LiDAR
# topic : is the name of the topic in which LiDAR's messages are being published
# marking , clearing : parameters determine whether the sensor will be used to add obstacle information to the costmap, 
                    #clear obstacle information from the costmap, or do both.
